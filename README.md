# Two-Step Task

## Overview
This project presents a space-themed online version of the Two-Step Task, designed to assess two types of reinforcement learning: model-free and model-based.

### Background
The Two-Step Task with Aliens is originally created by [Decker et al. (2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4899156/). The materials and design used here have been adapted from [Nussenbaum et al. (2020)](https://online.ucpress.edu/collabra/article/6/1/17213/114338?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Collabra%253A_Psychology_TrendMD_0) and resources available from the [Nivlab Demos](https://nivlab.github.io/jspsych-demos/)

### Project
No Way Around But Through: Mechanisms of Persistence and Remission of Habits in Anorexia Nervosa by Dr. Joanna Steinglass and Dr. Karin Foerde.

## Phases of the Task
The task is divided into four main phases:

1. **Tutorial**: Participants are familiarized with the task rules.

2. **Learning Phase**: Main task part where participants make two sequential decisions and learn associations between different spaceships, planets, aliens and rewards. They 

3. **Post-Task Testing Phase**: This phase evaluates the participants' understanding and retention of the associations learned in the previous phase.

4. **Probe Phase**: Participants are required to make decisions based on the probability of certain aliens granting treasure, reflecting their learned associations.

## Usage
For online use, clone or fork this repository to use the task through Pavlovia. For local use, Builder version of the task must be adapted to ensure data is output correctly.
