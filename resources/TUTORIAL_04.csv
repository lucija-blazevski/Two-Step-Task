"Good. You might have learned that this alien had treasure more often. Also, even if this alien had a better mine, you couldn't be sure if it had treasure all the time. Each alien is like a game of chance, you can never be sure but you can guess.

"The treasure an alien can give will change during the game. Those with a good mine might get to a part of the mine that is hard to dig. Those with little to share might find easier treasure to dig. For example, it is possible that the alien that was giving you treasure most of the time in the beginning, gets to a part of the mine that is hard to dig and starts sharing treasure less often. These changes in an alien's mine will happen slowly, so try to focus to get as much treasure as possible.

"While the chance an alien has treasure to share changes over time, it changes slowly. So, an alien with a good treasure mine right now will probably stay good for some time. To find the alien with the best mine at each point in time, you must concentrate.

"The aliens will appear on different sides from trial to trial, so it is important to remember what each alien looks like, as their position will change.

"The planet a spaceship goes to most won't change during the game. Spaceships will always be on the same side. Pick the one that you think will take you to the alien with the best mine, but remember, sometimes you'll go to the other planet!

"Let's practice before doing the full game. Remember, you want to find as much space treasure as you can by asking an alien to share with you.
The aliens share somewhat randomly, but you can find the one with the best mine at any point in the game by asking it to share! How easy it is for an alien to get treasure out of its mine changes slowly over time, so keep track of which aliens are good to ask at each point in the game.

"How much bonus money you make is based on how much space treasure you find. This is just a practice round of 20 flights, you're not playing for money now.
